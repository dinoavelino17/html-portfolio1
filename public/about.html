<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>"Hi everyone!  Iâ€™m a under graduate from Philippine Christian University where I studied Hotel and Restaurant Management back in 2012. My career journey has been quite diverse - from my early days working as a cook in various restaurants and hotels to serving as a Customer Service Representative and Fraud Analyst. One of the highlights of my experience was working on a Carnival Cruise Ship, which was an incredible adventure!.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm diving into the world of web development, eager to transition into a new and exciting career path. Learning about coding and web technologies has truly ignited a passion in me, and I can't wait to see where this new journey takes me. Here's to embracing change and pursuing new challenges.</p>
